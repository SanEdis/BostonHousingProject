# BostonHousingProject

Machine learning project where I used various dimension reduction/feature selection machine learning models such as ridge regression and lasso regression, as well as best subset selection and forward selection, in order to predict Boston housing prices.

`housing.csv` concerns housing values in suburbs of Boston. The dataset was created by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. and analyzed in *'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environment Economics and Management, vol. 5, 81 - 102, 1978*. There are 506 observaitons and 12 continuous attributes including the response variable `MEDV`.
